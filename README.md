## Giffy
# by Alexander Lee

This application is a cheap little toy for wasting time. The page is built using a simple html file to build the basic page and that is animated with a little CSS tinkering. The main crux of this app is the api that finds gifs to match the key word we supply it. I used some clever Jquery to build the buttons in the topic view and the user can use the input filed to create their own topics. When the user clicks the buttons, the test in it becomes a key phrase that will be used in an api call. That api call will then return the image and push it to the gif view in a still image to switch to the animated one when the image itself is clicked.

This is not a glamourous tool by any means but will help you kill a few minutes with some crazy gifs.
